## Graph Databases

Graph databases are designed to store, manage, and query graph-structured data. They come in two main categories: **Property Graphs** and **Triple Stores**. Below are some key tools and their respective languages.

### Property Graph Databases

Property graphs allow nodes and edges to have associated properties, making them useful for more detailed graph representations.

## Graph Stream Processors

Graph stream processors enable real-time graph computations within event-stream processing systems. They integrate seamlessly into ETL pipelines or event streams, allowing graph operations to be performed on incoming data streams. These tools consume events, apply graph-based transformations or analyses, and emit processed events, facilitating dynamic graph processing as data flows through the system.

- [Quine](https://quine.io/) ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-brightgreen) ![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Scala-blue) - Quine allows developers to combine multiple event streams into a single graph, query for complex event relationships to identify high value patterns, and take an action in real time.
